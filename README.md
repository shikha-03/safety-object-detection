# safety-object-detection
We built a YOLO-based object detection system trained on 2,100+ synthetic images simulating real space station conditions—varying lighting, occlusions, and camera angles. Our model detects 7 critical object categories with high accuracy, enabling real-time autonomous monitoring.
